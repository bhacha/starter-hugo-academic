I graduated from Purdue University Fort Wayne (f.k.a. IPFW) in 2019 with a B.S. in Chemistry. I conducted research there under Dr. Michael Columbia, where I looked at the sol-gel transitions of a complex polysaccharide: gum arabic.

In 2019, I began graduate school at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and joined Randy Goldsmith's group in the same year.
